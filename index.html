                    My favorite language for a long time. I used it as a scripting language, wrote 2d games, console utilities,
                    scientific  calculations and surely web-sites in it. I follow the development of jRuby — an interpreter of
                    Ruby on Java Virtual Machine — with great interest.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Usage of Ruby in different fields of software development allows me to consider my knowledge
                    of language to be <span class="experience">advanced</span>.

                <p>
                    I got acquainted with JavaScript in 2003 in the field of web-development. I like JS for it unique prevalence
                    in the world and I follow the news of language realizations with great pleasure. I appreciate the usage of
                    ECMAScript 5 features and I am looking forward to ECMAScript 6 being accepted as a new standard.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Taking into consideration my long acquaintance with the language I consider myself an
                    <span class="experience">advanced</span> JS developer.

                <p>
                    I used to develop in these languages until 2010. At the present time I rarely write in one of them, even
                    mainly read the source code. Unlike other languages, described in this section, I don't  constantly follow
                    the development of these languages.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I might have forgotten some things, but still consider my knowledge to be <span class="experience">strong</span>

                    It's the only language in this section, that I haven't used in production. However I like the ideas of
                    the language and OTP approaches. I am looking forward to possibility to use Erlang in real projects.

    <p class="description">
        ShoeDazzle - probably one of the most interesting projects, in which I took part, especially in terms of technologies.
        There often was a possibility  to use the whole spectrum of technologies from <span class="experience">JavaScript</span> and
        <span class="experience">jQuery</span> to Stored Procedures and <span class="experience">Rack Middleware</span> in one task.
    </p>

        for working with some functions of rating products.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
        A lot of my efforts were directed to code refactoring in order to simplify the supporting of the code and adding new features.

        in deep refactoring of complex process of checkout, in change in mobile authentication process, in change in routing mechanism.
        Also I took part in design and development of projects, that were not announces by ShoeDazzle.
    </p>

    <p class="interesting-fact">
        An interesting challenge was the transfer of the whole code base from Rails 2.3.x to Rails 3.x.
        For example, in order to simplify the migration was made a decision to make a backport of possibilities of newer version of devise to the older one.

        My fellows from Taucraft offered me to slightly change my specialization and work as pure front-end developer.

        in JavaScript for targetprocess 3 — project management software system - maybe the most powerful existing.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
        Unfortunately, during my work with the company I understood that I would like to return to Ruby and made a hard
        decision to leave Taucraft. However I gained unique experience of working with complex GUI, built on JS and.
        I still try to catch every news about this great product.
    </p>

    <p class="interesting-fact">
        Web-developers from Taucraft designed a complex system of message exchange and asynchronous test framework for GUI based on it.
