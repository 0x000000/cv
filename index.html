  <h3>Programming Languages</h3>

  <table class="programming-skills">
    <tr>
      <td class="lang">Ruby (7+ years)</td>
      <td>
        <p>
          My favorite language for a long time.
          I used it as a scripting language, wrote 2d games, console utilities, scientific
          calculations, and surely websites.
        </p>

        <p>
          My experience with Ruby in different fields of software development allows me to
          consider my knowledge to be on an <span class="experience">advanced</span> level.
        </p>
      </td>

    <tr>
      <td class="lang">JavaScript / TypeScript (10+ years)</td>
      <td>
        <p>
          I got acquainted with JavaScript in 2003. I like JS for its unique prevalence in the world
          and I follow the news of language realizations with great interest. I appreciate the usage
          of ES6+ features and I absolutely love TypeScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking into consideration my long experience with the language I consider myself an
          <span class="experience">advanced</span> JS developer.
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td class="lang">C / C# / Java (2+ years)</td>
      <td>
        <p>
          I used to develop in these languages until 2010. At present I rarely use one of them
          full-time, mainly to read through source code or write small games with C# and Unity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Unlike other languages, described in this section, I don't constantly follow the
          development of these languages. And while I might have forgotten some things, I am still
          considering my knowledge to be <span class="experience">strong</span> in any of them.

  <h2>Major Projects</h2>

  <h3 class="company">PeerStreet (US)</h3>
  <h4>5/2015 <span>&#x2192;</span> present </h4>

  <p class="description">
    For five years I've participated in countless projects, most of them related with out main tech
    stack: <span class="experience">Rails + Vue.js + PostgreSQL</span>.
  </p>

  <p class="description">
    One of the many services I've developed is a system for dynamic form generation with validations
    and event-driven architecture. We use it to speed up the data collection process for the
    internal team. I was working on architecture and implementation phases, both for DSL-heavy
    Ruby-code and front-end libs based on Vuejs and custom event delivery system.
  </p>

  <p class="description">
    Another interesting project I developed not so long ago is a scoring engine, based on business
    rules conception. With tight time limits, a small team of engineers including me was able to
    deliver a high-quality scoring system that still handles rapidly growing requirements.
  </p>

  <h3 class="company">The Honest Company (US)</h3>
  <h4>2/2014 <span>&#x2192;</span> 5/2015 </h4>

  <p class="description">
    I mostly dealt with the development of CMS features for the retail website
    (<span class="experience">Angular</span> / Ruby on Rails / MySQL).
    Worked on integration between our platform and Oracle's ERP system.
  </p>

  <p class="interesting-fact">
    One of my tasks was to integrate our internal shipment returns system with FedEx, so we can
    replace hours of manual work with a couple of mouse clicks. When we introduced the new
    automation system, my CTO sent me a huge list of thanks from the Client Support division with
    dozens of good words. This knowledge that you have helped so many people to save their time and
    make their chores easier was so satisfying! </p>
  </p>

  <h3 class="company">Altoros Development (Belarus) / ShoeDazzle (US)</h3>
  <h4>6/2011 <span>&#x2192;</span> 10/2012 and 12/2012 <span>&#x2192;</span> 12/2013</h4>

  <p class="description">
    A lot of my efforts were directed towards huge code refactoring processes like transferring all
    CSS code to Sass, changing the way our checkout process work, simplify the mobile authentication
    process.
  </p>

  <p class="description">
    One of the many projects I dealt with was the transition from external user review service
    to the internal solution we developed to cover our needs.
  </p>

  <p class="interesting-fact">
    An interesting challenge was the transfer of the whole codebase from Rails 2.3.x to Rails 3.x.
    For example, to simplify the migration we decided to make an API backports of some modern gems
    to support old Rails 2.x.
  </p>

  <h3 class="company">Taucraft (Belarus)</h3>
  <h4>10/2012 <span>&#x2192;</span> 12/2012</h4>

  <p class="description">
    My fellows from Taucraft offered me to drastically change my specialization and start working as
    a pure front-end <span class="experience">JavaScript</span>
    developer for Targetprocess 3 — super powerful and flexible project
    management system.
  </p>

  <p class="description">
    Unfortunately, during my work with the company, I understood that I would like to return to the
    full-stack role and made a hard decision to leave Taucraft. But I gained a unique experience
    about how to work with a huge customizable UI based on the event-steams concept.
  </p>

  <p class="interesting-fact">
    Web-developers from Taucraft designed a complex system of client-side message exchange and
    asynchronous test framework for GUI based on it. These ideas have no analogs on the internet at
    the present moment.
  </p>


  <h3 class="company">Altoros Development (Belarus) / Monterosa (UK)</h3>

    the deployment process.
  </p>

  <p class="description">
    Optimized the search by using geospatial function with <span
      class="experience">PostgreSQL</span>.

    <span class="experience">Spring</span>) for a quick ticket search and booking.
  </p>

  <p class="description">
    Developed a simple cryptographic service to handle requests with some ticket aggregators.
    I made it possible to minimize the request/response time for clients by introducing
    several levels of caching, including homebrew key-value storage written in Java.

  <p class="interesting-fact">
    Some ticket aggregator systems forced us to send more than 20 requests in a row, instead of just
